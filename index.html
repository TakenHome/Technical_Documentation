        <p>
         <strong>VANGUARD</strong> is polyphonic analogue-modelled synthesizer with an
          arpeggiator and an effect section. Many years ago, synthesizers were
          built using analogue components for creating oscillators, envelopes
          and filters. These synthesizers revolutionized the music instrument
          market: it became possible to play synthesized sounds on a classic
          piano keyboard.
        </p>

        <p>
          Synthesizers also invented new electronic music styles and added new
          elements to classic styles (e.g. rock music), but there were a few
          problems with these machines: they didn't have enough voices, they had
          tuning problems, they had no midi functionality, and they were
          technically problematic.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>VANGUARD</strong> is more than a simple synthesizer, included
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>31 different oscillators</li>
          <li>3 low frequency oscillators (LFOs)</li>
          <li>
            13 filter types and a variety of effects:
            <ol>
              <li>Trancegate</li>
              <li>Delay</li>

          <h1>OSC - The Oscillators</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          As mentioned previously, VANGUARD has up to three oscillators per
          voice. You'll find the oscillator section on the top left:
        </p>
        <code
          >Each of the three oscillators has its own volume and semitone tuning knobs. “vol” controls the volume and “semi” sets the tuning in semitones: the “semi” setting has a range from -36 to +36 semitones (-/+3 octaves).</code
        >
      </section>
      <section id="LFO_-_The_Low_Frequency_Oscillators" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>LFO - The Low Frequency Oscillators</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>VANGUARD</strong> has three independent triangle oscillators.
          Select the LFO you want by edit with the “1”, “2” or “3” switch.
        </p>
        <code
          >Please note that the LFOs are hard wired to the corresponding oscillator: LFO 1 can only modulate the pitch and pulsewidth of the first oscillator, LFO 2 is for oscillator 2 and LFO 3 handles of course- oscillator 3. All three LFOs can modulate the cutoff frequency of the filter.
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SPEED:</strong> sets the speed of the LFO, which is a value
            between 0 and 60 hertz.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DETUNE:</strong> modulates the pitch of the corresponding
            oscillator. Negative values will slow down the pitch, positive will
            speed them up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PWM:</strong> is responsible for the pulsewidth. According
            to the “detune” parameter, it affects the pulsewidth negative or
            positive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CUTOFF:</strong> modulates the cutoff frequency of the
            filter.

          <h1>FILTER – The Multimode Filter Section</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>VANGUARD</strong> is equipped with 13 different filter-types,
          including standard low-pass and high-pass variations and a selection
          of several notch- and band-pass filters.
        </p>
        <code>
            Select a filter-type, just click on the green type field and the list of filters will appear.

      <section id="AMP_–_The_Amplifier" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>AMP – The Amplifier</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          After the audio signal is synthesized, modulated and filtered, it ends
          up in the amplifier section.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Drive” adds high gain – the higher the drive, the more distorted the
          signal will become. “drive” emulates a guitar-overdrive effect. The
          output will be very aggressive and loud, but it will also lose its
          brilliance, so better use it carefully!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to drive is the “volume” knob – please remember that the “master
          volume” setting on the upper panel is scaled with the volume. Set both
          volumes to 127 for the highest output possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          “veltrk” is velocity tracking. Set “veltrk” to 0 if you don't want the
          velocity to control the output volume – all notes will be played at
          the same volume, independently of the velocity. Positive values will
          make the amp louder the higher the velocity is – negative values will
          make it more quiet the higher the velocity is.
        </p>
        <p>
          “pan” sets the panorama position of the output signal. According to
          the knob, it can be set smoothly from hard left to center and to hard
          right.

          <h1>TRANCEGATE – An automated and synchronized Gate</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          The trancegate offers an easy solution for creating typical trance
          rhythmic sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>VANGUARD's</strong> trancegate is based on a 16-step on/off
          pattern. Use your mouse to switch the 16 segments on or off.
        </p>
        <code>
            <strong>VANGUARD's</strong> trancegate is fully stereo-enabled, so you can have different patterns for the left and right channel. Simply click on the stereo-button next to the on/off button to toggle between mono and stereo operation.

      <section id="Delay_&_Reverb_Effects" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Delay & Reverb Effects</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          After the signal passes the amplifier and trancegate, delay and reverb
          can be added. Both effect blocks are routed in series; the signal
          flows first into the delay and then into the reverb.
        </p>
        <h3>Delay – Adding Echo</h3>
        <p>
          The delay emulates a classic band-echo, but is easier to control, and
          of course without a tape.
        </p>
        <h3>Reverb – Room Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          The Reverb simulates reflections from surrounding walls or objects; it
          is a room simulator. With reverb, your sounds will be more natural,
          deeper and wider – but be careful: adding too much reverb or too big
          of room sizes can result in a muddy signal.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>MIX:</strong> sets the output volume of the reverb – the
            higher, the louder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ROOM SIZE:</strong> defines the actual size of the room.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DAMP:</strong> dampens the signal; it cuts off higher
            frequences and works like a low-pass filter. A value of 0 will not
            change the delayed signal – the higher the value, the more high
            frequencies will be cut off (same as “damp” in the delay section).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WIDTH:</strong> is responsible for the stereo width. If the
            reverb is fed a mono input, the stereo input will automatically be
            converted to mono. W the output of the reverb is stereo and the
            “width” parameter will define more spatial rooms.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h1>ARP – The Arpeggiator</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          What is it? Basically it takes the notes from a chord (or any other
          combination of keys) and splits them into single notes to form
          patterns. An arpeggiator gives you fresh inspiration: switch it on,
          press some keys on your keyboard and listen to the melody.
        </p>
        <code>
            The arpeggiator is –of course- tempo synchronized. Click on the “speed” field to set the tempo, which can be 1/1, ½, ¼, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 or 1/64 note duration. Triolic and punctuated values are also possible: “T” is for triolic and “D” for punctuated note lengths.
